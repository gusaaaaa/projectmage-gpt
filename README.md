# ProjectMage

ProjectMage is a tool that allows project and product managers to automatically create tickets of many kinds (epics, user stories, tasks, etc.) and formats for different PM tools (Jira, Trello, GitHub, etc.) with just a few indications.

It uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework with [React](https://reactjs.org/), and connects to the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/).

6. Add your [API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file
